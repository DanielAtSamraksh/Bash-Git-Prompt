If in a terminal shell then exit and open a new shell.


Alternative Installation method

Usage

Bash shell prompt will change to display repository information when a change directory is done into a git repository.

The prompt will display various info, for example:

user@system(89m|master|?AM)$

89m: Last commit was 89 minutes ago. Color will go from green to yellow to red
     depending on how long ago a commit was performed. Green<60m<Yellow<120m<Red

master: On branch master

?AM: Git file flags. '?' for untracked files. 'A' for newly added uncommited files. 'M' for modified uncommited files.


Tested on Ubuntu 10.04.

Enjoy!
